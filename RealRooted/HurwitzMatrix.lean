# Hurwitz matrix criterion interface

This file records checked interface lemmas for the Hurwitz-matrix worker.  The
classical analytic theorem is not proved here; the point is to expose the exact
finite-minor statement needed by the existing `VeroneseSection` route.

/-! ### Entrywise Hadamard structure of Hurwitz matrices

The coefficientwise Hadamard product of two polynomials corresponds, at the
level of Hurwitz matrices, to the entrywise product of the two Hurwitz
matrices.  Every entry of `hurwitz c` is either `0` or a single coefficient
`c k`, so replacing `c` by the pointwise product `fun n => a n * b n`
multiplies each entry by the corresponding entry of the other matrix. -/

/-- Entrywise product identity for Hurwitz matrices.  The Hurwitz matrix of a
coefficientwise product of sequences agrees, entrywise, with the product of
the two Hurwitz matrices. -/

  by_cases hi : i % 2 = 0 <;>
    simp only [hi, Matrix.of_apply, if_true, if_false] <;>
      split <;> simp

/-- Matrix form of `hurwitz_mul_entrywise`: the Hurwitz matrix of a
coefficientwise product is the entrywise product of the two Hurwitz matrices. -/
theorem hurwitz_mul_entrywise_matrix (a b : ℕ → ℝ) :
    hurwitz (fun n => a n * b n) =
      Matrix.of (fun i j => hurwitz a i j * hurwitz b i j) := by
  ext i j
  simp only [Matrix.of_apply]
  exact hurwitz_mul_entrywise a b i j

/-- Pure-matrix combinatorial core of Garloff--Wagner Theorem 1.

This is the deep leaf of the reduction, stripped of analytic and polynomial
content: the entrywise product of two totally nonnegative Hurwitz matrices is
again totally nonnegative.  This is special to the Hurwitz block-Toeplitz
structure; the entrywise product of arbitrary totally nonnegative matrices is
not totally nonnegative in general. -/
